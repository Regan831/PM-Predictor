Welcome to Ryan's Dissertation code. Most of the notebooks are a lot of the same
 code but with minor variations for different experiments. Most of this is a
 mess so I'm sorry.

constants are constants for the temporal models
cnnConstants are the constants for the temporal CNN
continuous-lstm is an lstm model just for temporal predictions
continuous-online - preliminary temporal only predictions
continuous-pred-grid-CNN - temporal and spatial predictions using a grid and CNN
continuous-pred-grid-OK - temporal and spatial predictions using a grid and Ordinary Kriging
continuous-pred-grid-temporal - temporal only predictions using a grid
Explore Leading Inidcators - A way of looking at the variables to see which visibly predict pollution
**Load Data - Loads, formats, and saves the Data
Mapping Heat Map - One way of mapping the pollution heat maps on a real map
model19 - CNN model taken from ZoÃ«'s work with slight alteration
spatial-lstm - an attempt at making an lstm work both spatially and temporally
